# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Do a `yarn install` to install packages. I have also added sass for css.

## Data Fetching

There is function in utils folder which mimicks API fetching with delays. It takes delay as aruguemnets and will return the resolved file. Dummy data can be added in `src/data/data.json`

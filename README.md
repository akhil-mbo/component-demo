# Getting Started with Component Demo

Do a `yarn install` to install packages. I have added sass and Clay UI for css.

## Data Fetching

There is function in utils folder which mimicks API fetching with delays. It takes delay as aruguemets and will return the resolved file. Dummy data can be added in `src/data/data.json`

## Code Formatting

- Make sure format on save is enabled on VS Code settings.
- Set ESlint is as default code formatter for ts, tsx, js, jsx files.
